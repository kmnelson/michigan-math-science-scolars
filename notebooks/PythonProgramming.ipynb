    "Numpy arrays are useful becuase they allow us to perform mathematical operations on several values all at once.  For example, if we have an array of numbers we can compute the square of each number without having to use a `for` loop.  This is accomplished via the `np.power` function which accepts and array and a number `n`.  Each element in the array is raised to the power `n`.  Similar `numpy` functions exist for multiplication, division, etc.  Try to compute $x^3+y$ for $x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$ and $y=[1,1,1,1,1]$"
