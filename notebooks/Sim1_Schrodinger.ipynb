When we put a gaussian wavepacket in the quadratic potential, it shifted to the left and right over and over again, shifting between potential and kinetic energy.  As the particle moved and its kinetic energy changes, it becomes a different combination of these basis shapes, which is why the animation moves at all over time.  The concept of a basis is an important one in quantum theory.\n",

Finally, multiply each value together at every point in `x` using `np.multiply` and use the function `sum` to \"integrate\".
